.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pimd.conf
.Nd pimd configuration file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/pimd.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In many cases you do not need to configure
.Nm pimd .
It configures itself automatically to forward multicast on all
multicast-capable interfaces, i.e., interfaces that have the
.Cm IFF_MULTICAST
flag set.  It locates other PIM-SM/SSM capable routers directly
reachable via those interfaces.
.Pp
.Nm pimd
will not start with less than two enabled virtual interfaces (VIFs).  A
VIF is either a physical multicast-capable interface or a tunnel.  To
override the default settings, for example to disable some interfaces
from being used, configuration commands may be placed in
.Pa /etc/pimd.conf .
.Pp
The file format is relatively free-form: whitespace (including newlines)
is not significant.  However, the order of some statements are
important, more on this below.
.Pp
All <masklen> arguments to an IPv4 address, group or network can also be
given in the alternative /CIDR format.  E.g., <group>/<masklen>.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
runs on all multicast capable interfaces.  The optional
.Cm disable-vifs
setting and the
.Cm phyint
setting can be used to control this behavior.  The former can also be
set from the command line using the
.Fl -disable-vifs
option.  More on the
.Cm phyint
interface configuration setting below.

.Pp
The
.Cm default-route-distance
option has nothing to do with the system default route.  It is the
default value for the unicast routing protocol's administrative
distance.  It is used in PIM Assert elections to determine upstream
routers.  Currently
.Nm
cannot obtain the admin distance and metric from the unicast routing
protocols, so a default routing protocol distance (the RFC confusingly
refers to this as
.Em metric prefererence )
may be configured.  In a PIM Assert election, the router advertising the
lowest assert preference will be selected as the forwarder and upstream
router for the LAN.  Setting 101 should be sufficiently high so that
asserts from Cisco or GateD routers are preferred over poor-little pimd.
.Pp
It is recommended that distances be set such that metrics are never
consulted.  However, default routing metrics may also be set using the
.Cm default-route-metric
option.  (Again, this has nothing to do with the system default route.)
This item sets the cost for sending data through this router.  You want
only PIM-SM data to go to this daemon; so once again, a high value is
recommended to prevent accidental usage.  The preferred default value is
1024.  Both defaults can be overridden per phyint, so learned routes, or
PIM Asserts use the phyint's values.
.Pp
Please also note that PIM Assert elections are not the same as the DR
election.  The PIM Assert election determines the active multicast
forwarder, whereas the DR election determines the active PIM router.
.Pp
Two settings for IGMP behavior are available:
.Cm igmp-query-interval
and
.Cm igmp-querier-timeout
which are similar, but very different.  The former controls the interval
between IGMP querys when elected as querier, the latter controls the
timeout for the elected querier -- before
.Nm pimd
decides to take over.  In IGMP the lowest numerical address in a LAN
becomes the elected querier.  Obviously these settings must be handled
with care.  The RFC recommends that the querier timeout is set to a
robustness value times the query interval, plus have the query response
time.  The pimd robustness value for IGMP is 3 and the default query
response time is 10 sec.  Since pimd v2.3.0 the default query interval
is 12 sec, which makes the querier timeut default to 41 sec, but this is
rounded off to 42 to honor the late Douglas Adams.
.Pp
The PIM Hello message interval can be tuned by changing the
.Cm hello-interval
setting.  Changing this value also affects the hold-time value included
in Hello messages.  The hold-time value is 3.5 times hello-interval.
The default value for the Hello interval is 30 sec.  Anything less than
30 sec is considered an "aggressive" setting and is unsupported.
.Pp
The
.Nm phyint
setting refers to a physical interface and must come after the
.Cm default-route-metric
and
.Cm default-route-distance
settings in the configuration file.  Select the interface either by its
IP
.Ar address
or interface name
.Ar ifname
(e.g. eth0).  If you just want to activate this interface with default
values, you don't need to put anything else on the line.  However, there
are some additional settings:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -width 1n -compact
.It
.Nm enable :
Selectively enable this interface for
.Nm .
Useful with the
.Fl -disable-vifs
command line option and the
.Cm disable-vifs
configuration file setting.
.It
.Nm disable :
Do not use this interface in
.Nm .
Default enable, unless
.Fl -disable-vifs .
.It
.Nm igmpv2 :
Force interface to use IGMPv2, or
.It
.Nm igmpv3 :
Use IGMPv3, this is the default since v2.3.0.
.It
.Cm dr-priority Ar <1-4294967294> :
When there are multiple PIM routers on the same LAN the DR is usually
elected based on the highest numerical IP address.  This setting can be
used to control the DR Priority option in PIM Hellow messages, which by
default otherwise is 1.  When the DR Priority option is advertised by
.Em all
PIM routers on the same LAN the highest priority router wins the DR
election, regardless of its IP.  If any router does
.Em not
advertise the DR Priority option, or the same priority is advertised by
more than one router, the protocol falls back to using the IP address.
.It
.Cm ttl-threshold Ar <1-255> :
The TTL threshold for multicast frames to be forwarded from this
interface.  Default: 1
.It
.Cm distance Ar <1-255> :
Use this to override the
.Nm default-route-distance
(101) on this
.Nm phyint
in PIM Assert elections.
.It
.Cm metric Ar <1-1024> :
The cost of sending data through this interface.  Defaults to
.Nm default-route-metric
(1024) if not assigned.
.It
.Cm altnet Ar <network/len> :
Alternative host(s)/network(s) to accept as locally attached multicast
sources on a given interface. If a phyint is attached to multiple IP
subnets, describe each additional subnet with the altnet keyword.
.It
.Cm scoped Ar <network/len> :
Optional scoping of multicast groups.  This allows interfaces to be
configured as an administrative boundary for the specified group(s).
Multicast streams belonging to the scoped groups will not be forwarded.
.El
.Pp
Add one
.Nm phyint
line per interface on this router.  If you don't do this,
.Nm pimd
will either be completely silent (if you provide the
.Fl -disable-vifs
command line option), or simply assume that you want to run
.Nm
on all interfaces using default settings.
.Pp
Both the
.Cm bsr-candidate
(CBSR) and
.Cm rp-candidate
(CRP) settings are enabled in the default configuration file.  You can
disable them by commenting them out, however, make sure at least one
bootstrap router (BSR) and at least one rendezvous-point (RP) in PIM-SM,
is available in the network.  Both settings share the following options,
with priority being interpreted differently:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -width 1n -compact
.It
.Nm address | ifname :
Optional local IPv4 address, or interface name to acquire address from.
If both address and ifname is left out,
.Nm
will default to the highest active IP address.
.It
.Nm priority Ar <0-255> :
How important this router is compared to others.  For CRP, the lower the
value the more important the router is considered.  For BSR it is of
course the exact opposite: a higher value is preferred.  If the priority
is left out
.Nm
and Cisco IOS defaults to 0 for both, but the standard says 192 for RP.
.It
.Nm interval Ar <10-16383> :
The advertisement interval in seconds for this CRP.  The default value
is 30 seconds.  Use a lower value for faster convergence.
.El
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
The
.Nm group-prefix
sub-setting to
.Nm rp-candidate
is the set of multicast groups that the CRP will advertise to other
routers, if it wins an election:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -width 1n -compact
.It
.Nm group :
A specific multicast group or network range this router will handle.
.It
.Nm masklen :
Optional number of groups, in prefix length format. Remember that a
multicast address is a Class D and has a netmask of 240.0.0.0, which
means its length is 4.
.El
.Pp
Multiple lines of
.Nm group-prefix
may be given, but max number of records supported in pimd is 255.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm rp-address
setting is for static rendezvous point (RP) configurations.  It defines
the RP for a given group, or range of groups.  The argument can be
either a unicast address or a multicast group, with an optional group
address and netmask.  Default group and netmask is 224.0.0.0/16.
.Nm Note:
all static RP's are announced with priority 1.
.Pp
The
.Nm spt-threshold
setting replaces two older configuration settings,
.Nm switch_data_threshold
and
.Nm switch_register_threshold .
It controls the switch-over from the shared tree to the shortest-path
source tree.  The default is to do the switch-over after the first
packet, but only after 100 seconds.  If
.Ar infinity
is specified the shortest path switch-over is disabled.
